    <p>A brainteaser is a type of riddle that makes one think outside the box. Some brainteasers are easy, some are a little 
        harder, and some can really make you ponder for a while. Often, when you finally hear the answer, you feel ignorant or 
        silly, because it should have been obvious to you. However, brainteasers are fun. Therefore, we keep testing ourselves 
        and hoping we get better at solving them.</p>
